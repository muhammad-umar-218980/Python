These are the basic string operations in python

1. Indexing and slicing
   - s[0], s[-1] to access individual characters
   - s[1:5], s[:3], s[3:] for substrings
   - s[::2] to skip characters

2. Concatenation and repetition
   - a + b joins two strings
   - a * n repeats a string n times

3. Membership tests
   - 'sub' in s returns True if substring found
   - 'x' not in s returns True if substring absent

Use these operations to navigate and build new strings.
